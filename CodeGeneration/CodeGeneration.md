# Code Generation

## Introduction
Code generation is always a tricky way of producing code, as the code is generated by a tool (seen as a black-bock, behaviour not modifiable) from a model and the obtained code slightly differs from what could have been obtained manually. 
Some rules have to be considered to avoid desesparation while trying to get expected code:
* a specific code generator is required for each target platform. Hence thinking that a single code generator would do the job for all your projects will generate massive frustration when linking obtained code with third party code.
* know your code generator capabilities, define properly your software interface and how data/functions are implemented (full force implementation or basic machine) 


## Glossary

*Basic machine*:

*Machine*:

*Refinement*:

*Implementation*:

*B0*:				subset of the B language that is directly implementable.This subset depends on the code generator

*B0 checker*:		tool to verify that an implementation complies with B0 constraints
